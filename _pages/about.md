I am a Research Economist in the Economics Research Division at [Banco de México](https://www.banxico.org.mx). I have a Ph.D. in Economics from [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/academics/economics/), and undergraduate degrees from [Universidad del Rosario](https://www.urosario.edu.co/Facultad-de-Economia/Inicio/). My research uses elements from Urban and Labor economics to study the effects of minimum wages and other place-based policies. 

I am currently working on:

* [Local labor markets in Mexico](/research/2025-1-24-mexico-llm)

* [The effectiveness of hiring credits in North Carolina](/research/2019-5-3-nc-hiring-credits)
