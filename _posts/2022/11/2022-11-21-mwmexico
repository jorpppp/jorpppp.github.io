excerpt: "In January 2019, in an effort to boost activity on the northern Mexican border, the authorities increased the minimum wage by 100 percent and decreased the value-added tax (VAT) by half. Disentangling both effects, we find increments in prices due to the minimum wage hike that were more than offset by the decreases associated with the VAT. In the absence of both policy changes, average prices would have been higher. The share of informal labor in the production of different goods seems to be playing a role in the impact of the minimum wage on prices."

In January 2019, Mexican authorities increased the minimum wage by 100% in Mexico's Northern Border Free Zone (ZLFN, by its spanish acronym, Zona Libre de la Frontera Norte), and at the same time, they reduced the VAT tax rate from 16% to 8%. In the rest of the country, the minimum wage increased 16.21% and the VAT rate did not change. In a recent [article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.labeco.2022.102294) with Mariana Calderón, Josué Cortés and Alejandrina Salcedo, we study the effects of these substantial policy changes on prices.
