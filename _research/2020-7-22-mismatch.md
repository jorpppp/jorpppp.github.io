excerpt: 'We analyze accessibility to jobs through different transportation modes and the extent of job spatial mismatch at the intra-urban level in a developing country city.  We use data from Medellín, Colombia, from 2012 to 2017, to measure accessibility using employment weighted by travel times. We find that despite the continuous investment in public transportation and transport infrastructure, spatial mismatch in Medellín has increased.'

Abstract: We analyze accessibility to jobs through different transportation modes and the extent of job spatial mismatch at the intra-urban level in a developing country city. We propose a methodology to calculate spatial mismatch and assess its evolution over time in presence of incomplete data, using a combination of reported travel times from origin-destination surveys and estimated travel time data from mapping applications. We use data from Medellín, Colombia, from 2012 to 2017, to measure accessibility using employment weighted by travel times. We find that despite the continuous investment in public transportation and transport infrastructure, spatial mismatch in Medellín has increased, and it is considerably larger for job seekers and workers using public transport compared to those using private transport.
