Abstract: Linear panel models, and the “event-study plots” that often accompany them, are popular
tools for learning about policy effects. We discuss the construction of event-study plots and
suggest ways to make them more informative. We examine the economic content of different
possible identifying assumptions. We explore the performance of the corresponding estimators
in simulations, highlighting that a given estimator can perform well or poorly depending on the
economic environment. An accompanying Stata package, xtevent, facilitates adoption of our
suggestions.
