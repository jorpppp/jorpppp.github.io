excerpt: ' We estimate the contribution of average workplace-specific wage premia, worker-level characteristics, and assortative matching on Mexico's wage inequality. We find that assortative matching explains between 16\% and 19\% of total wage variance, while worker- and workplace-specific factors contribute between 35\% to 42\% and  33\% to 38\%, correspondingly. The importance of workplace factors in determining wage inequality correlates negatively with regional economic development.'

Abstract: We use a matched worker-workplace dataset comprising the universe of formal private-sector workers in Mexico to estimate the contribution of average workplace-specific wage premia, worker-level characteristics, and assortative matching on Mexico's wage inequality between 2004 and 2018. To this end, we regress log earnings on sets of worker and workplace fixed effects and perform a decomposition of total wage variance. We find that assortative matching explains between 16\% and 19\% of total wage variance, while worker- and workplace-specific factors contribute between 35\% to 42\% and  33\% to 38\%, correspondingly. The importance of workplace factors in determining wage inequality correlates negatively with regional economic development: it is lowest in the North, Mexico's most-developed region, and largest in the South, the country's least-prosperous region.
