excerpt: "We analyze how the pandemic shifted traveler preferences in Mexico’s Airbnb market using hedonic price models. Valuation for amenities tied to remote work, open spaces, and reduced contact—like workspaces, beach fronts, and private areas—rose significantly during COVID-19. These changes occurred despite relatively light tourism and mobility restrictions in the country."

We study how the COVID-19 pandemic changed the valuation of amenities in the prices of Airbnb listings in Mexico, a country with few tourism and mobility restrictions. Using the universe of Airbnb listings in Mexico from 2018 to 2022, we estimate hedonic price models and analyze how hedonic coefficients changed for amenities associated with lower COVID-19 infection risk and reduced face-to-face contact. Our results show that the valuation of remote-work amenities --such as workspaces--, open-space amenities --such as beach fronts--, and reduced-contact amenities --such as private spaces-- significantly increased during the pandemic.
