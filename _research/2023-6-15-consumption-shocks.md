excerpt: 'We analyze the effect of adverse health shocks on different expenditure shares. We find that households engage in substitution between health expenditures and food expenditures. We also find important heterogeneity in this trade-off between present health and future health mediated by access to social protection, job contract type, and location (urban-rural).'

Abstract: We analyze the effect of adverse health shocks on households’ expenditure shares in different good categories using a fixed-effects approach and a structural approach based on microeconomic theory. We find that households substitute health and food expenditure in response to adverse health shocks. We find substantial heterogeneity in this trade-off between current and future health mediated by access to social protection, job contract type, and location (urban-rural). Households from rural areas –where household heads are more likely to hold informal jobs and lack access to safety nets– are more vulnerable
than others. Our findings suggest that access to formal employment and a higher quality of local institutions can help mitigate the negative consequences of health shocks.
