excerpt: 'This paper introduces the xtevent package for estimating and visualizing policy effects in linear panel event-study designs. It builds on recent methodological advances from Freyaldenhoven et al. (Forthcoming) to allow for flexible treatments, pre-trend adjustments, and more informative event-study plots. The package is designed to make best practices in estimation and visualization accessible to applied researchers.'

Abstract: Linear panel models and the “event-study plots” that often accompany them are popular tools for learning about policy effects. We introduce the xtevent package, which enables the construction of event-study plots following the suggestions in Freyaldenhoven et al. (Forthcoming, Visualization, identification, and estimation in the linear panel event-study design [Cambridge University Press]). The package implements various procedures to estimate the underlying policy effects and allows for nonbinary policy variables and estimation adjusting for preevent trends.
