excerpt: "While Mexico has improved the education of its labor force, has had a stable macroeconomic environment, and has been friendly to international trade, its labor market still faces many challenges. Particularly, Mexico has difficulties creating high-paying jobs: The share of informal employment has remained stagnant for the last 20 years, and by 2025 remains at around 50%. These problems are particularly poignant in southern Mexico. "
