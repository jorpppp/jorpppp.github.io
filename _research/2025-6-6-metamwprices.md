excerpt: "We review the literature on how minimum wage increases affect prices. We conduct a meta-analysis of 199 elasticity estimates, finding that a 10% minimum wage increase raises prices by 0.3% to 1.1%. Elasticities are smaller in broader categories of goods but larger in narrow, labor-intensive sectors."

Minimum-wage studies have shifted focus from the impact on employment to other adjustment margins that may explain the limited employment response to minimum wage changes. We review the recent literature on the effect of minimum wage increases on prices, which was last surveyed before the rise in the popularity of quasi-experimental research designs. We then conduct a meta-analysis of 199 estimates of the elasticity of prices to minimum wages. Our meta-estimates of this elasticity range from 0.03 to 0.11, meaning that a 10\% increase in the minimum wage leads to a 0.3 to 1.1\% rise in prices. Recent quasi-experimental studies for broad categories of goods tend to find smaller elasticities. In contrast, studies focused on narrower, labor-intensive industries tend to see larger price pass-throughs of minimum wage increases.
